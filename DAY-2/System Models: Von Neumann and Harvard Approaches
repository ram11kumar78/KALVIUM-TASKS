  "learner_journey": "Introduction\nI’ve always wondered how different computer architectures impact how computers work. In this lesson, I will explore the Von Neumann and Harvard system models, focusing on how they process instructions and data. This understanding will help me see how computer architecture influences modern computing.\n\nOverview of Von Neumann and Harvard Models\nI will begin by exploring the Von Neumann model, which uses a single shared memory for both data and instructions. I’ll see how this design leads to the 'Von Neumann bottleneck.' Then, I will move on to the Harvard model, which separates memory for instructions and data. I will learn how this design increases efficiency by allowing simultaneous access to both.\n\nComparing the Models\nNext, I will compare the two models, understanding the trade-offs between them. I’ll see how the Von Neumann model is simpler and more common, but the Harvard model is faster and more suitable for specialized applications.\n\nWhy These Models Matter Today\nI will also learn why these models are still relevant today. Modern systems, including CPUs and specialized processors like GPUs, use elements of both models to optimize performance. Understanding these architectures helps in designing better computing systems.\n\nLearning Outcome\nBy the end of this lesson, I will be able to explain the Von Neumann and Harvard system models, highlight their differences in how they handle instructions and data, and understand how these architectures are applied in modern computing systems."
