  ""learner_journey"": ""Introduction\nI’ve often wondered how some computers can handle many tasks at once while others focus on one. In this lesson, I will discover how computers are categorized based on how they process instructions and data. This will help me understand the different capabilities of various systems—from laptops to powerful servers.\n\nOverview of Parallel Processing Systems\nI will first learn about parallel processing. I will explore how some computers can process multiple instructions or data streams at once, while others work more sequentially. This will show me why different system designs are needed for different tasks.\n\nUnderstanding Flynn’s Classification\nI will dive into Flynn’s Classification, which groups computers based on how many instruction streams and data streams they handle. I will learn about the four categories: SISD (single instruction, single data), SIMD (single instruction, multiple data), MISD (multiple instruction, single data), and MIMD (multiple instruction, multiple data). I’ll see how each category applies to real-world systems, such as traditional CPUs, GPUs, and more.\n\nWhy This Matters for Modern Processors\nI’ll also explore how Flynn’s Classification is still relevant today, especially for modern processors. Understanding these categories helps me understand how modern CPUs and parallel computing systems are optimized for performance and multitasking.\n\nLearning Outcome\nBy the end of this lesson, I will be able to identify the four types of computer systems in Flynn’s Classification (SISD, SIMD, MISD, MIMD), relate them to real-world systems with simple visuals, and understand why these classifications are essential for analyzing the structure and performance of modern processors.""
