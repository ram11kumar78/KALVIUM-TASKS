  "previous_module_name_with_description": "Amdahl’s Law and Its Impact on Performance\nDescription: This module covered Amdahl's Law, explaining the limitations of speedup in parallel processing. You analyzed how a system's non-parallelizable portion impacts the overall performance, and how to estimate realistic improvements through optimization.",
  "instruction_designer_input": "This lesson is structured using the ADDIE framework and aligns with Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction. It connects theoretical concepts like clock rate and CPI to practical performance impacts using visual aids, formulas, and real-world analogies. Simulations and guided reflection are used to reinforce learning and develop systems-level thinking.",
  "learner_journey": "Introduction\nI’ve always been curious why some computers feel faster than others, even when they have the same processor brand. Today, I’m diving into what really makes a CPU fast. It turns out it’s not just about clock speed—there’s a lot more going on under the hood.\n\nBreaking Down the Core Metrics\nI begin by understanding the three main metrics:\n- Clock Speed – how fast the CPU ticks\n- CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) – how many cycles each instruction takes\n- Instruction Count – how many instructions a program uses\n\nPerformance Formula\nCPU Time = (Instruction Count × CPI) / Clock Rate,\nI see how each factor contributes to overall execution time.\n\nThe Role of Pipelining and Parallelism\nI explore how pipelining helps the CPU do more in less time by overlapping instruction stages, and how superscalar and parallel processing further boost performance. I simulate a few pipelines and notice how hazards or stalls can slow things down.\n\nWhat Slows CPUs Down?\nCache misses, branch mispredictions, and memory latency—these are the hidden culprits. Through simple animations or case studies, I discover how each bottleneck impacts execution and how smart CPU design tries to overcome them.\n\nOptimizing for Performance\nNow I think like a system designer: Should I increase the clock speed or reduce CPI? What about optimizing software to reduce instruction count? These trade-offs help me understand that improving performance isn’t just about hardware—it’s also about smart choices in design and coding.\n\nLearning Outcome\nBy the end of this lesson, I will be able to identify the key metrics affecting CPU performance, apply the CPU time formula, explain the role of pipelining and parallelism, and evaluate the trade-offs in optimizing CPU performance.",
